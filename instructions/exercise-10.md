## The `isDate` function

### Before starting: 
    - Install all dependencies with `npm install`
    - Run your tests in the terminal with `npm t` or `yarn test`
    - Optionally, you can run the tests in watch mode with `npm t -- --watch` or `yarn test --watch`

### Todo

- [ ] Implement the `isDate` function in the `src/08-isDate.js`file
- [ ] The `isDate` function takes a value as a parameter, and returns true if parameter is an Object Date else returns false.

```js
const date = new Date('01/01/2001')() {};
console.log(isDate(date));
// Output: "true"
```

### Important note:
You cannot modify the tests suites. If you find an issue, please, let us know via email (007@hackages.io) or via the platform. 

The goal of these exercises is to teach you how to write code in JavaScript as you will in real world projects.
