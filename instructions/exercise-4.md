## The `first` function

### Before starting: 
    - Install all dependencies with `npm install`
    - Run your tests in the terminal with `npm t` or `yarn test`
    - Optionally, you can run the tests in watch mode with `npm t -- --watch` or `yarn test --watch`

### Todo

- [ ] Implement the `first` function in the `src/02-first.js`file
- [ ] The `first` function takes an array and an optional number as parameters, and returns the n first element of that collection.

```js
const array = ["apple", "orange", "pear", "banana"];
console.log(first(array));
// Output: "apple"

console.log(first(array, 2));
// Output: "[apple, orange]"
```

### Important note:
You cannot modify the tests suites. If you find an issue, please, let us know via email (007@hackages.io) or via the platform. 

The goal of these exercises is to teach you how to write code in JavaScript as you will in real world projects.
