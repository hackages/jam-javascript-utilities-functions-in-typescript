## The `identity` function

### Before starting: 
    - Install all dependencies with `npm install`
    - Run your tests in the terminal with `npm t` or `yarn test`
    - Optionally, you can run the tests in watch mode with `npm t -- --watch` or `yarn test --watch`  **Recommended**.

### Todo

- [ ] Implement the `identity` function in the `src/identity.ts` file
- [ ] The `identity` function takes 1 argument as paramater, and returns that element.

```ts
const value = "this is a weird function";
identity(value); // "this is a weird function"
```

### Important note:
You cannot modify the tests suites. If you find an issue, please, let us know via email (007@hackages.io) or via the platform. 

The goal of these exercises is to teach you how to apply types on function, variables, classes and more in TypeScript.
