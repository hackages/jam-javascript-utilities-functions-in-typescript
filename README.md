 ## Important notes

 Each exercise is available on 1 branch at the time. To unlock the next exercise, you'll have to pass the test for the current exercise. If you find yourself stuck, click the `Halp button` on the platform and a mentor will help. 

Each time you clone a new exercise, you should first open the `instructions folder`.

    For Premium users, you can access the video/solution of each exercise via the solution tab. The solution tab will contain a possible solution for this section of the Jam.
